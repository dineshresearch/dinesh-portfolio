        description: "Led architecture and enterprise rollout of AgentStack, a cloud-native agentic AI platform on AWS Lambda, EKS, and API Gateway. Standardized multi-agent design patterns and distributed reasoning across organization. Delivered production-grade chat copilot using LangGraph, LangChain, FastAPI, and LLMs with tool usage, memory, and stepwise reasoning. Built scalable RAG pipelines with hybrid retrieval, semantic re-ranking, and automated AI output testing. Achieved 70% ops effort reduction and $250K+ annual savings.",

        description: 'Worked on fine-tuning Mistral-7B LLM for domain-specific question answering using RLHF, DPO, LoRA, QLoRA, and PEFT. Designed end-to-end alignment pipelines addressing challenges in alignment stability and efficient training. Built high-fidelity preference datasets and trained reward models. Applied parameter-efficient techniques reducing fine-tuning compute by ~40%. Achieved 30-45% accuracy improvements and 25%+ boost in preference alignment.',
